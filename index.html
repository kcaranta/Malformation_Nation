                    <div class="large-8 medium-8 columns">
                        <p>Recent reports of amphibian declines and frog malformations have caused great concern among the public and scientific communties. Multiple limbs, missing limbs, and facial abnormalities are striking hallmarks of the developmental malformations seen in these frogs (see Malformation Gallery). Although amphibian abnormalities have been addressed in the scientific literature for some time, it was not until 1996—when a group of Minnesota middle school students visited a local pond during a field trip and discovered large numbers of abnormal frogs—that the general public and Congress began to take notice. Soon thereafter, reports began surfacing from other areas of North America that frogs with similar malformations were present. This issue is still very much alive, and new malformations sites continue to be discovered each year. To date, malformations have now been documented in XX species of frogs and XX species of toads from XX states in the USA, with occurrences as high as XX percent in some local populations (citation).</p>
                        <p>In cooperation with the greater scientific community, the “Malformation Nation” website serves as a resource for people to learn about the amphibian malformation phenomena in North America and for concerned citizens to report on the health of local amphibian populations. The growing increase of citizen science as a tool for ecological research and public engagement provides an indispensable means of continental-scale monitoring of the temporal and spatial changes in malformed amphibian occurrence and severity, information that is vital to amphibian conservation efforts.</p>

                        <p>If so, we encourage you to report your sightings using the online reporting forms on our “Malformation Nation” FieldScope page, sponsored by the National Geographic Society. See the Report Data tab for data collection forms and instructions.</p>

                        <p>There, you can also get information on the extent of malformation reports received to date, including geographic distribution, information on the types of malformations found and species affected in each area.</p>
