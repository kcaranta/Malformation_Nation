                        <p>In the past decade, extensive research into the amphibian malformation phenomena has been undertaken by scientists from government, academic, and non-profit sectors. Below we present information on the history of data collection from these diverse sources, all of which has been critical to obtaining a deeper understanding of the environmental factors driving patterns of amphibian malformation occurrence.</p>

                        <h3>North American Reporting Center of Amphibian Malformations</h3>
                        <p>Some of the earliest work in amphibian malformations arose from the U.S. Geological Survey’s North American Reporting Center for Amphibian Malformations (NARCAM; Johnson et al. 2000). NARCAM was established in June 1997, following several months of discussions among federal and state agency staff, herpetologists, and other scientists, to facilitate the flow of information in two directions. First, scientists and the public could learn about the phenomenon, as well as where malformations had been found, the rates at which they were recorded, the species involved, and the types of malformations noted. Second, suspected or confirmed malformation observations could be reported to NARCAM’s centralized database so that scientists can search for patterns and trends in the type and incidence of malformations. However, due to federal budget cuts the NARCAM program was discontinued in XXXX. Fear not though! Our website, in conjunction with that National Geographic Society’s FieldScope environmental education platform, serves as the new portal for learning more about and submitting reports of malformed amphibians across North America. We hope you will join us in continuing this important citizen science effort!</p>

                        <h3>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</h3>
                        <p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Division of Environmental Quality is also actively involved in studying amphibian declines and malformations. In 2000, the Service launched a nation-wide scientific survey to determine the extent of abnormal frogs and toads on national wildlife refuges, revealing important insights into the geographical patterns of malformed amphibians in the USA. To better study amphibians and the concerns facing them, the Service developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for abnormal amphibian surveys on wildlife refuges. The Service’s Amphibian Declines and Deformities web page provides more information about how this federal government agency is working to conserve threatened and endangered amphibians.</p>

                        <p>Recently, the USFWS was part of an unprecedented 10-year-study (Reeves et al. 2013) revealing encouraging results for frogs and toads on national wildlife refuges. The results showed that, on average, less than 2 percent of frogs and toads sampled across 152 refuges had physical abnormalities involving the skeleton and eyes; a lower rate than many experts feared based on earlier reports. This suggests that the severe malformations such as missing or extra limbs reported in the media during the mid-1990s were actually very rare on national wildlife refuges. However, it is important to point out that this study did not include surveys of amphibian malformations on private lands or other non-refuge public lands. Reeves et al. (2013) reported the presence of areas where sites with higher rates of abnormalities tend to cluster together geographically. Within these regional “hotspot” clusters—found in the Mississippi River Valley (northeast Missouri, Arkansas and northern Louisiana), the Central Valley of California, and in south-central and eastern Alaska—the frequency of abnormalities often exceeded the national average of 2 percent, affecting up to 40 percent of emerging amphibians in some individual samples. This effort represents the first nationwide survey of abnormal amphibians that uses standardized collection and evaluation methods.</p>

                        <h3>University of Colorado at Boulder</h3>
                        <p>The Johnson Lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado has been conducting research on the occurrence and causes of amphibian malformations for over a decade. Researchers in the Johnson Lab focus on bringing a broad perspective to the amphibian malformations phenomenon by combining experiments, large-scale spatial and temporal field data, molecular tools and ecological modeling in their investigations.</p>

                        <p>In cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, members of the Johnson Lab are examining parasites of amphibians collected across National Wildlife Refuges in the United States. These data will be invaluable toward understanding (i) how ecological community interactions among parasites affect the abundance of pathogenic species, (ii) exploring how parasite abundance and richness covary in response to latitudinal, longitudinal and land use gradients, and (iii) evaluating whether aquatic parasites can be use as indicators of environmental condition. To learn more about the diversity, distribution and pathology of parasitic infections in North American aquatic communities, please visit the Aquatic Parasite Observatory website hosted by the University of Colorado.</p>
